title: Migrating from a blogging service to Jekyll and GitHub
---

Since 2010, and until a week ago, I had my site powered up and hosted by a paid **blogging service**.

The **good** thing with (paid) blogging services is that they handle:

- Storage for posts
- Storage for comments
- Atom and/or RSS feeds
- Support for social networking services
- Site analytics
- Themes
- Customisation


The **bad** thing with blogging services is that they own your content and are very limited when it comes to:

- Access the files via FTP client(s).
- Backup/Export posts
- Backup/Export comments
- Customise the creation of web feeds
- Add new social networking services
- Add new themes

I believe that nowadays all the above stuff is trivial so it should be done in very simple way.

Thus, one **should be able** to:

- Compose posts on [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/ "Dillinger is a cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor."), [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/ "MarkdownPad is a full-featured Markdown editor for Windows.") or even [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html "A fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting. This program can be run out of the box without installation, and does not touch your system's registry.").
- Customize and style a site using open source templating systems, markdown engines and syntax highlighting tools.
- Host the generated output on any web server.

Furthermore, I do believe that in the future we will use (**even more**):

- Twitter for social networking and microblogging.
- GitHub for open source and commercial closed source project hosting.

With all the above and since GitHub allows for publishing web content I decided to move into that direction. The migration was successful.

This site is now powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby"). Using [this](http://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator) plugin I was able to keep all the old permalinks and redirect to the new ones.

> The only [limitation](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/325) I came across is that GitHub runs Jekyll with the --safe switch and it will not load any custom plugins (for security reasons). However, one can run the site locally and copy the output that is being generated by the plugin and include it in the source.

Some key **highlights**:

- Posts can now be written using [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or HTML.").
- The site can be previewed locally by installing the Jekyll  [Gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll).
- The creation of web feeds is highly customisable.
- The format of [permalinks](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Permalinks) is very flexible.
- On each push, GitHub transforms the code (using Jekyll) into a static site.

I like it pretty good, let's see how it goes.
