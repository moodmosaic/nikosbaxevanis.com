<p>When I&#39;m on the plane, I usually read (on paper or Kindle). The last time was a couple of weeks ago and I was reading the excellent&#0160;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/REST-Practice-Hypermedia-Systems-Architecture/dp/0596805829" target="_blank" title="REST in Practice: Hypermedia and Systems Architecture (Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis, and Ian Robinson)">REST in Practise</a>&#0160;book.</p>
<p>On the first page,&#0160;<em>Advance Praise for REST in Practice </em>I read this:</p>

<p>Here is the description from the&#0160;<a href="http://www.caelumobjects.com/opensource/" target="_blank">Caelum Objects</a>&#0160;website:</p>
<blockquote><p>A restful framework based on the four constraints defined by Roy Fielding. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS" target="_blank" title="HATEOAS, an acronym for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from most other network application architectures.">HATEOAS</a> within its core in order to be able to create loosely coupled distributed systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am looking forward trying <a href="http://restfulie.caelum.com.br/" target="_blank" title="Restfulie - Restful made easy">Restfulie</a>!<em>&#0160;</em>For those interested, I found the .NET version of the server&#0160;<a href="https://github.com/mauricioaniche/restfulie.net" target="_blank">here</a>&#0160;and the client implementation <a href="https://github.com/caelum/restfulie-net" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
