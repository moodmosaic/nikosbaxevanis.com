title: Replace C# primitive types with FCL types in Visual Studio
---

<blockquote>
<p>A nice Visual Studio macro, for those who prefer not to use the C# language primitive types and use the&#0160;corresponding&#0160;FCL types instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people writing C# code prefer to use the FCL types:</p>
<ul>
<li>String</li>
<li>Int32</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know in Visual Studio there is no way to automate this process. It would be good if you could just select some code and just hide built-in type names. For that reason I wrote <a href="https://github.com/moodmosaic/BonusBits.CodeSamples/tree/master/VSMacros" target="_self">this</a> Visual Studio macro.</p>
