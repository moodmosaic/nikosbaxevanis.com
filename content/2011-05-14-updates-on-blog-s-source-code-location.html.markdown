title: Updates on Blog's Source Code Location
---

<p>Today I moved all the code samples to a single project named BonusBits.CodeSamples which can be found <a href="https://github.com/moodmosaic/BonusBits.CodeSamples" target="_blank" title="BonusBits Blog source-code.">here</a>. &#0160;I updated (almost) all the articles and blog posts to reference the new location.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s easier to have everything under a single solution and get updates for everything with a single git-pull cmd ;)</p>
