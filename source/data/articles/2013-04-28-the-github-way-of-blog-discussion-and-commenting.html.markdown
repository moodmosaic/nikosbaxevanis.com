Using the underlying power of [GitHub](http://github.com/), blog authors often take a step further and roll their own discussion and commeting systems.

The best examples are:

 * [Add a comment by sending a pull request](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/03/03/moving-the-blog-to-jekyll/) by [Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/)
 * [Add a comment through the GitHub API](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) by [Ivan Zuzak](http://ivanzuzak.info)
 * [Add a comment as a GitHub issue](https://github.com/holman/feedback) by [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/)

With the evolution of blog-aware static site generators, like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), GitHub is becoming a central part for hosting both blog content and comments.
