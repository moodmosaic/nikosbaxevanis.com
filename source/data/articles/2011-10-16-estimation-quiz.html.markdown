<p><em>Given some instructions, provide an estimate for the process of assembling a shelf (see picture below).</em></p>

**Academic approach**

<p>After <span>spending</span> several minutes thinking, you estimate it to 30 minutes and &#0160;then start assembling the parts in order to build the shelf.<em><strong><br /></strong></em></p>

**Pragmatic approach**

<p>Depending on the complexity of the assembling and the quality of the given instructions the whole process can fall out of any estimation.</p>

<p>..and from the initial estimate of 30 minutes you can end up in a 10 hours of actual work.</p>
