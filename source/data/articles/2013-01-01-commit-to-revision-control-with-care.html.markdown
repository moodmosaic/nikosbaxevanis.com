We should always commit to [revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) with care.

Often, developers provide commit messages that are *incomplete*, *lowercase*, with *orthographic permutations*. Even worse, snapshots can contain code that doesn't even compile.

In a signed document the rules and regulations can be altered and then another document is going to be created and signed, but the original document will always remain signed.

>As signatures in documents can't be erased so do recorded snapshots, at least it is not always an easy task.

After a snapshot has been recorded it acts like a signature for the developer &ndash; should we ever put our signature roughly?
