The definitions about Hackers, Developers, and Programmers, that I like best are:

>"Hackers are generally loners who don't care if others can figure out their code (at least while they are in the mode or role of hacking). Thus, they build their own little world in it that fits themselves nicely so that they can hack fast, but the rest of the world be damned." -- *[c2.com/wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LispIsTooPowerful)*

>"On the 'programmer' vs. 'developer' debate: 'Programmer' focuses on the 'craft'. 'Developer' focuses on the business. Both are valuable." -- *[@ploeh on twitter](https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/297803382050140160)*

I am a programmer -- You?
