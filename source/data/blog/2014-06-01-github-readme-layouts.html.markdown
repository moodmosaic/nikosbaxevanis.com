In most common scenarios, README files can have one of the following layouts.

**Basic**

* Introduction
* Where to download?
* License
* Versioning scheme
* Build instructions
* Contributing guidelines
* Credits

The basic layout might seems too much in the beginning, but I think this is quite essential and valuable information that each open source project could have. 

>Being able to scan through each of these sections saves a lot of time.

**Extended**

* *Basic* + 
* What problem does the project address?
* Who cares?
* How does it work?

Including these additional sections in the README almost **eliminates the need to write** an introductory **blog post** about the project.

**Mature**

* *Extended* +
* Open source maturity level<sup>1</sup>
* Documentation
* Questions
* Who uses it?
* Additional resources

As the project becomes bigger and successful, these additional sections tend to **minimize potential duplicate questions** on Stack Overflow **and** questions as **issues** on GitHub.
