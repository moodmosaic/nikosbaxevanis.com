At first, Nikos submitted pull requests to AutoFixture, and exhibited endless patience with my various suggestions. Not only that, but he kept contributions coming in a steady flow of high quality, to such a degree that he's now a core contributor to AutoFixture.</i></p><p><i>Likewise, when I started a new open source project called Albedo, Nikos expressed interest in joining, and based on my trust in him, I immediately made him a core contributor to Albedo as well - a decision I haven't regretted for a moment.</i></p><p><i>Since we live in different countries, we've only met a few times, so all our collaboration has been via CodePlex (initially) and GitHub. This seems to work well for both of us.</i></p><p><i>If I ever find myself in a situation where I need to hire a programmer, Nikos would be one of my first choices.    </i></p><p class="author">- Mark Seemann</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p><i>We hired Nikos during 2012-2013 to helps us extend and maintain our MobileCoupons touchscreen application. Nikos re-designed and re-engineered our code successfully from VB6 to C# in 3 weeks to help us release new features and iterate faster. </i></p><p><i>In a few months, MobileCoupons' gave us the opportunity to create and release another product - MyABTouchPoint for AB Vassilopoulos retail chain - where Nikos helped us in design and development.</i></p><p><i>Nikos has been delivering results of high quality in-full and on-time. Today we easily extend and maintain our products, MobileCoupons and MyABTouchPoint, thanks to Nikos' methodological and professional work.</i></p><p class="author">- MPASS</p></blockquote><br /><div><hr />Published by <a href="/">Nikos Baxevanis</a>.</div></div><script type="text/javascript">var _gaq = _gaq || [];
