At first, Nikos submitted pull requests to AutoFixture, and exhibited endless patience with my various suggestions. Not only that, but he kept contributions coming in a steady flow of high quality, to such a degree that he's now a core contributor to AutoFixture.</p><p>Likewise, when I started a new open source project called Albedo, Nikos expressed interest in joining, and based on my trust in him, I immediately made him a core contributor to Albedo as well - a decision I haven't regretted for a moment.</p><p>Since we live in different countries, we've only met a few times, so all our collaboration has been via CodePlex (initially) and GitHub. This seems to work well for both of us.</p><p>If I ever find myself in a situation where I need to hire a programmer, Nikos would be one of my first choices.</p><div>- Mark Seemann</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-tape" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div><script type="text/javascript">var _gaq = _gaq || [];
