<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>p. ix</h3>

<p>Example from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Happens-Theyre/dp/0140139966">How Buildings Learn [Brand 94]</a> by Stewart Brand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Build a new campus with no sidewalks at all. Wait for the first winter and photograph where people make paths in the snow between the building. The next spring, put the pavement there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>p. xxi</h3>

<p>Reuse is an act of trust.</p>

<h3>p. xiii</h3>

<p>Excerpt from the journal <a href="http://virtualschool.edu/cox/pub/NoSilverBulletRevisted/">No Silver Bullet Revisited [Cox95]</a> by Brad Cox:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike the hardware industry, which has organized itself into a fully elaborated rainforest of mutually interdependent structure of production trees, the software industry remains stuck in the unicellular, bacterial stage of the primordial ooze.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>p. xvii</h3>

<p>Robert C. Martin spoke at a conference in Chicago to a rather large audience regarding design patterns.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He asked who had purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612">GoF</a> book. About 80 percent raised their hands. Then he asked everyone who had not actually read the book to put their hands down. About half the hands went down. Then he asked who could explain the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor pattern</a>. Nearly all the hands went down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>p. xvii</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Study the patterns and integrate them into your mental model of software design. Then when you are designing software, the patterns will present themselves before you even know you have a design problem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<h3>p. xviii</h3>

<p>The acknowledgments section includes Gerard Meszaros, who wrote the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Code/dp/0131495054">xUnit Test Patterns</a> book.</p>
