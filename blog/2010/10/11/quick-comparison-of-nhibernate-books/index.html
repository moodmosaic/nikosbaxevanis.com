<p>NHibernate In Action is written by members of NHibernate (Pierre Henri Kuat√©, Tobin Harris)&#0160;and Hibernate (Christian Bauer, Gavin King) team. It contains a lot of stuff about the internals, such as,&#0160;the persistence lifecycle, the persistence manager, transitive persistence, the NHibernate type system, advanced query techniques, optimizing object retrieval (I could go on).</p>

<p>NHibernate 2 Beginner&#39;s Guide, written by Aaron Cure,&#0160;targets those who have not used an ORM yet. It helps you find&#0160;about what is NHibernate, why would you use it, where do you get it, and more. It guides you on how to create mappings (XML and <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank" title="Fluent NHibernate, a statically compiled alternative to NHibernate&#39;s standard hbm xml mapping.">Fluently</a>), types, relationships and more. It contains a whole chapter about Code Generation and even talks about&#0160;<a href="http://nhforge.org/wikis/burrow/introduction.aspx" target="_blank" title="NHibernate.Burrow is a light weight middleware developed to support .NET applications using NHibernate as ORM framework by providing advanced and smart session/transaction management and other facilitates.">Burrow</a>.</p>

<p>NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook, written by&#0160;Jason Dentler, is the most recent and most updated. In the chapter about mappings, (besides XML and Fluently) it discuss about creating mappings in code using&#0160;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/codeconform/" target="_blank" title="ORM configuration by code.">ConfORM</a>.&#0160;It describes the Conversation per Business Transaction pattern, the use of Futures, NHibernate Spatial and more! It focus on testing and describes the use of NHibernate Profiler and the Fluent NHibernate Persistence Tester among other. It even promotes design patterns and talks about using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank" title="Dependency injection (DI) in object-oriented computer programming is a design pattern with a core principle of separating behavior from dependency ...">dependency injection</a> with entities.</p>
