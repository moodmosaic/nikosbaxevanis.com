<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sin No.3</span>: Ignoring cross-cutting concerns.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach becomes very clear. It will be hard and tedious work, inside each test, to create stubs and mocks for each and every aspect.&#0160;The intent of the unit tests will also look wrong since, in reality, these aspects should not be treated as<em>&#0160;</em>dependencies of the&#0160;<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html" target="_blank" title="The &quot;system under test&quot;. It is short for &quot;whatever thing we are testing&quot; and is always defined from the perspective of the test.">SUT</a>.</p>

<p>Among others, logging and caching are cross-cutting concerns that can easily slip through the services (making us treat them as normal dependencies).&#0160;</p>

<p>While the preferred way to model these aspects is using decorators and/or dynamic interceptors,&#0160;there are many times that we see classes violating the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" title="In object-oriented programming, the single responsibility principle states that every object should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.">SRP</a>&#0160;containing <em>all-in-one</em> logging, caching, auditing and other aspects (and even violating the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle" target="_blank" title="The notion that many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.">ISP</a>&#0160;with a coarse-grained&#0160;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HeaderInterface.html" target="_blank" title="A header interface is an explicit interface that mimics the implicit public interface of a class.
